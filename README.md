# bottie
##Simple XMPP/Jabber BotKit bot with NLP

###*Original blog post avalaible on Andrew Templeton's blog:*

http://blog.templeton.host/self-training-nlp-enabled-slack-bot-tutorial/

This was re-written to work with XMPP.

<br><br>
##**Step 1** - Get Your Jabber/XMPP Server Credentials

<br><br>
##**Step 2** - Download the bottie code to your computer

If you're here on **GitHub**, you already know what to do. Navigate to the downloaded project folder *(on your computer)* and run the the following commands *[no dollar sign is required, used for reference only]*:

- **RUN** - `$ npm install;`
- **RUN** - `$ export XMPP_JID='my-username';`
- **RUN** - `$ export XMPP_PASS='my-complex-password';`
- **RUN** - `$ export XMPP_HOST='someserver.example.com';`
- **RUN** - `$ node index`

##**Step 3** - Learn and build on the bottie code
To learn how to interact and use the Bot, [read Andrews blog post](
http://blog.templeton.host/self-training-nlp-enabled-slack-bot-tutorial/). It's a great starting point for those looking to build / extend a bot to fit their project needs.  


<br>**Bonus points:** Examples of how to use sentiment and make JSON calls have been included in this example. You might also want to look at Adam-nnl's bot (https://github.com/adam-nnl/owb-bot/) for other ideas on how to extend bottie.
